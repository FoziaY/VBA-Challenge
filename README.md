# VBA Challenge - The VBA of Wall Street

## Background
You're on your way to mastering Excel and programming! This assignment involves using VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data. Depending on your comfort level with VBA, you can challenge yourself with some optional tasks.

## Instructions
Develop a script that will:
- Loop through all the stocks for one year for each run.
- Gather the following information:
  - Ticker symbol.
  - Yearly change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  - The percent change from opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.
  - The total stock volume of the stock.
- Implement conditional formatting to highlight positive changes in green and negative changes in red.

## Challenges
Enhance your solution to also find:
- The stock with the "Greatest % increase".
- The stock with the "Greatest % Decrease".
- The stock with the "Greatest total volume".

Modify your VBA script to run on every worksheet (every year) by running it once.

## Other Considerations
- Utilize the dataset in alphabetical_testing.xlsx for code development, as it's smaller and allows for faster testing (less than 3-5 minutes).
- Ensure consistency of the script across sheets. The beauty of VBA is automating repetitive tasks with a simple click.
